INTRODUCTION
------------

* Everyone loves to listen to music but it is unable to classify for a normal person that what type of genre is it or how exactly it sounds. 
How Classical sounds Classical, jazz like jazz and so on. 

* Through this project we are tried to provide a visual representation of how each music looks and the way they differ from each other.
With help of some Machine Learning and Deep learning algorithms we executed the following project.

* And for the Dataset we have used the GTZAN Music Dataset which contain over 1000 songs of 30 seconds along with 10 genres 


REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires some machine learning and deep learning libraries like:
- Tensorflow/Keras
